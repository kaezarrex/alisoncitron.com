			Although I have lived in Raleigh for most of her life, I can't imitate a 
			Southern accent to save my life. It is the little things that bring me the 
			most joy in life, from buying new shampoo, taking polaroid pictures of my 
			favorite people and places, anything made on a letterpress (especially if 
			I’m the one making it) die cuts, sparkly paper, cable television and office 
			supplies, particularly post-it notes.
		</p>
		<p>
			I try to make the most of Raleigh's beautiful weather by being outdoors as 
			much as possible, but if I’m not outside, you can probably find me 
			hunched over the computer, working on a design project
		</p>
		<p>
			
			I graduated from North Carolina State University in May 2010. Since then, 
			I has been putting her bachelor's degree in graphic design to good use. 
			My goal in life is to help make the world a place where great graphic 
			design is the standard, not the exception. With each project, I strive to 
			continue my education, and grow in my passion. Nothing makes me happier than a job well done, and I won't stop working until I’m happy.

			Does this sound good to you? I am currently looking for 
			freelance work. I can help you with branding, posters, book 
			design, website design, etc. Get in touch!
